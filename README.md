# py-leetcode
Instead of going crazy and doing new questions every day, I do 1-2 new questions per day (depending on the difficulty of the question) and review 3-4 previous questions. So in each directory you can see a main.go file that is my code for the first time I did the question, and the other review_&lt;date>.go files are my code for the review.
