# py-leetcode
I aim to tackle 1-2 new questions per day, depending on their difficulty, and review some previous questions.

Namespace
First Attempt: I will name the `file main.py`.
Review: I will name the file `review_date.py`.

I will use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to remind me to review the practice.
